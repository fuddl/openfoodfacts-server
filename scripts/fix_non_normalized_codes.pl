=head1 NAME

fix_non_ronalized_codes - A script to fix non normalized codes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Products code needs to be normalized to avoid confusions in products (false distinct).
But there may be leaks in the code, or some other tools (eg import scripts) 
that creates non normalized entries in the MongoDB or on the file system.

This scripts tries to check and fix this.

=cut

my $usage = <<TXT
fix_non_normalized_codes.pl is a script that updates checks and fix for products with non normalized codes

Options:

--dry-run	do not do any processing just print what would be done
